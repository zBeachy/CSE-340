How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One,
which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? 
How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

  - I think that by separating out the different aspects of the stack into different files, you inherently allow for more maintainable, readable, and adaptable. The organization
    of the code by throwing specific functions of the program into unique files keeps the troubleshooting process nice and easy because depending on the error, you know exaclty where
    to look and make edits. This organization also assists with maintainablility because if there are updates that need to be made to the code base, the aformentioned organization
    makes it easy to know where changes must be made. Adaptability is also of promenence because minor updates would be needed to reuse code. The CRUD python module, for example,
    could be adapted to work in countless situations where interfacing with any sort of mongoDB would be required. 
  
    
How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested.
How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases
to meet other client requests?

  - Approaching a problem as a computer scientist starts with assessing and understanding the requirements that are put forward and then when starting to research or work with the problem,
    consider the solution through the lens of what a computer system, be it hardware or software, could be used to solve the problem. In the case of the dashboard requirements set by
    Grazioso Salvare, I spend a great amount of time reviewing the dash documentation to have an understanding of how to implement the functions. In the future, I can use the information
    gained from this project as a jumping off point when dealing with database and client requests. From there, it is important to review the specifics of the requests and once again consider
    what tools would be best suited to solve the problem and further review the documentation of those tools to assess their capability in fufilling the need of the customer.
    
    
What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

   - The field of computer science is so large so I think it is hard to easily generalize on the subject and professions contained within. Through the manipulation and design of computer
     systems, either through hardware or software, a computer scientist seeks to utilize computer technologies to solve problems. The reason why it matters is evident in the review of
     the last 60 odd years of history. Essentially, the world has rapidly changed in almost every facet due to the benefits of computer technology. Looking at Grazioso Salvare as a specific
     example, easing access to a large database and filtering the data to be more organized to their needs would greatly expedite the manpower involved in sourcing good candidate dogs.
     By making that process easier, the selection process becomes easier and works faster, and in turn potentially could save lives. By equiping them with the tools they need to source
     good search and rescue animals, there are, at the end of the pipeline, more quality search and rescue animals ready and prepared to do what they do best and help people during times of
     crisis.
